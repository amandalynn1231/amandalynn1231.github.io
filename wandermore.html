			<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>

			<p>Wandermore began as the product of a 4-hour hackathon, called ideahack, hosted by IdeaLab. Since, I have collaborated with some members of the hackathon team to expand on our original ideas and to bring a design perspective to the project.</p>

			<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>

			<p>How do I become familiar with an area? </br>
				How can I experience familiar places in a new way?</p>

			<h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>

			<p>To address this problem, we created Wandermore, a mobile application that lets you become as familiar with the neighborhood as the locals. With Wandermore, you can create a tour of a local area with customizations such as a specific end destination, time constraints, and interests.</p>

			<p>For this project, I made wireframes, created original logos and typography, designed the interface and user experience, and built out a small, clickable prototype.
