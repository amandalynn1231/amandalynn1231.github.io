				<p>Wandermore is a mobile application that lets you become as familiar with the neighborhood as the locals. With Wandermore, you can create a tour of a local area with customizations such as a specific end destination, time constraints, and types of activities.</p>

				<p>This project began as the product of a 4-hour hackathon, called ideahack, hosted by IdeaLab. Since, I have collaborated with some members of the hackathon team to expand on our original ideas. For this project, I made wireframes, created original logos and typography, designed the interface and user experience, and built out a small, clickable prototype.</p>
