			<h4>THE CLIENT</h4>

			<p><a href="https://www.cinchfinancial.com/" class="link">Cinch Financial</a> is a small financial tech startup. They have curated a list of the best financial products to make finding good financial services easier for the consumer. </p>

			<h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
			
			<p>Cinch offers various ways of accessing their curated list. These include simply reading the list of serices and products (Cinch Picks), taking a short survey to get more personalized recommendations, or sending Cinch a copy of your bill in return for a specific recommendation (BillSnap). For Cinch to give the best recommendation, they need as much information about your current financial situation as possible. 

			<p>Cinch put my small cross-functional consulting team up to the task of improving the user experience of the site and working towards driving more users to engage with the site’s offerings. </p>

			<h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>

			<p>My team suggested adding an account linking feature that would allow users to link their financial accounts to their Cinch account, and ultimately receive the best financial advice and recommendations.</p>

			<p>We reached this solution through several interviews with the target audience as well as online surveys, which all indicated users would be interested in linking their respective financial accounts to a "Cinch Account."</p>

			<p>Even before tackling the design of the account-linking feature, I first decided that the home page could benefit from a clearer presentation of the various modes of accessing the Cinch Picks. Previously, Cinch's home page had a navigation bar which provided links to each type of service for which they have curated lists (Banking, Credit, etc...), a small introduction panel, and a large section linking to BillSnap. This layout wasn't communicating all that Cinch has to offer a user. Some site-mapping revealed various access points to the "personilization" methods throughout the site, so these interactions were being overlooked. To address this problem, I seperated the "personalization" methods from the Cinch Picks to create a sense of hierarchy and bring these interactions to the user's attention. </p>

			<p> Beacuse the account-linking was a brand new feature and Cinch didn't have a lot of previous user and/or usability stats, I based my design off of personas of Cinch's target users. Cinch's target user is one that isn't interested in spending hours researching financial services; perhaps, they even find the process annoying or confusing. I focused on creating a simple and straighfoward experience that suits the personas and that can be easily built upon by the Cinch team in the future. I streamlined the interface design with the site’s existing aesthetic, and used conversational phrasing of prompts to reflect Cinch's self-proclaimed nature of being your "friendly financial advisor who is on your side." In the end, I delivered a <a href="http://cinchprototype.netlify.com" target="_blank">prototype</a> of the interface and experience for user testing that is fully functional and responsive. </p>
